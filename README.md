# The-Dump
A place where you can put any program, file (No harmful ones though, that's bad)!



## How the commit flow works

- You make a file, and commit it to the Commits-Here-Plz Branch.
- Someone can then make a Pull Request to the Main branch, a Git Council member will review the changes/work, and Either deny, approve, or add something else.
